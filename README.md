# net-sim — software AX.25 packet network simulator

A software-only simulator for testing AX.25/IL2P link-layer behaviour,
BPQ routing decisions, collision recovery and hidden-node interactions
without real radios. Multiple
[samoyed](https://github.com/doismellburning/samoyed) instances act as
TNC+radio combinations; an audio router (`sim-router`) implements per-link
topology and FM capture-effect mixing between them.

The primary target is **2m FM AX.25** behaviour. SSB and other modulation
schemes are not modelled in v1. Real-radio quirks (TX rise time, RX
recovery, mic AGC, pre/de-emphasis) are explicitly out of scope.

```

The router is **DSP-unaware**: each samoyed child does all modulation /
demodulation; the router moves opaque PCM bytes between them and applies
attenuation, the FM-capture mixing decision, and optional white noise.

The audio path is entirely userspace (`stdin` for RX, UDP datagrams for TX
between samoyed and the router). No PulseAudio, PipeWire, JACK, or
`snd-aloop` is involved. See `NOTES-audio-io.md` for the gory detail.

## Quick run (Docker)

Pre-built images on ghcr:

```
docker pull ghcr.io/packethacking/net-sim:main
```

Bundled default network (two AFSK1200 nodes, KISS on `8001`/`8002`):

```
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 -p 8001:8001 -p 8002:8002 \
  ghcr.io/packethacking/net-sim:main
```

Open <http://localhost:8080> for the web UI; KISS-attach your AX.25
application to `localhost:8001` / `localhost:8002`.

For a custom topology — point at any YAML on the host, and use
`--network=host` so KISS ports can land anywhere without you having to
predict them:

```
docker run --rm --network=host \
  -v $PWD/my-network.yaml:/etc/sim/network.yaml \
  ghcr.io/packethacking/net-sim:main
```

Tags published:
- `:main` and `:main-<sha>` on every push to main
- `:vX.Y.Z`, `:X.Y`, `:X`, `:latest` on tagged releases

Embedding in another project's tests (e.g. as a fixture for your AX.25
client / BPQ-style router): mount your network YAML, expose the KISS
ports your test connects to, and use the two probe endpoints —

- `GET /healthz` → `200 ok` once the HTTP server is accepting connections
  (use as a readiness probe).
- `GET /api/status` → JSON; check `running:true` to confirm the router
  brought all the samoyed children up.

The default Docker `CMD` is `-autostart`, so `running:true` is the
expected steady state right after startup. Override (`docker run ...
ghcr.io/.../net-sim:main` with extra args) if you'd rather drive
Start/Stop manually from your test harness via `POST /api/start`.

### Smoother audio under host load (`-rt-priority`)

The router paces audio with 10 ms tickers and every TNC child runs a
software demodulator; on a busy shared host, scheduler jitter glitches
both (lost ticks → choppy RX audio → decode failures that look like RF
problems). `sim-router -rt-priority` renices the router *and* each
spawned TNC child to `-10`. Deliberately plain niceness, not
`SCHED_FIFO` — a real-time policy could starve the host; niceness is
enough to keep the tickers honest. It's best-effort: without
`CAP_SYS_NICE` you get a one-line warning and the simulation carries on
at normal priority.

Granting the capability in Docker (`--cap-add SYS_NICE`), or in compose:

```yaml
services:
  net-sim:
    image: ghcr.io/packethacking/net-sim:main
    cap_add: [SYS_NICE]
```


> **Nested-container hosts:** on a host that is itself an unprivileged container (e.g. Docker inside an unprivileged Proxmox LXC), the kernel checks CAP_SYS_NICE against the *init* user namespace, so negative nice is unavailable to anything inside — even container root. The flag then logs its one-line warning and the sim runs at normal priority; everything else is unaffected.

## Quick install (curl | sudo bash)

On a fresh Debian 12 / Ubuntu 24.04+ host (LXC, VM, bare metal — anywhere
you have root and apt):

```
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/packethacking/net-sim/main/install.sh | sudo bash
```

That script installs apt build-deps, clones and builds samoyed at
`/opt/samoyed`, clones and builds net-sim at `/opt/sim`, installs the
binaries to `/usr/local/bin/`, bootstraps a default two-node network at
`/etc/sim/network.yaml`, and (where systemd is present) registers and
starts a `sim-web.service` listening on `:8080`.

Then open <http://your-host:8080/>. The default page lets you edit the
YAML topology and Start / Stop / Apply-and-restart the simulator.

Override knobs (set as env vars before `sudo bash`):

| Var | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `SIM_DIR` | `/opt/sim` | net-sim checkout |
| `SAMOYED_DIR` | `/opt/samoyed` | samoyed checkout |
| `NETWORK_YAML` | `/etc/sim/network.yaml` | the active config |
| `WEB_PORT` | `8080` | sim-web listen port |
| `SYSTEMD` | `1` | set to `0` to skip the unit |
| `SIM_REF` | `main` | net-sim git ref to check out |
| `SAMOYED_REPO` / `SAMOYED_REF` | `M0LTE/samoyed` @ ACKMODE commit | samoyed source — temporarily pinned to the ACKMODE fork (see "Known limitations"); revert to `doismellburning/samoyed` `main` once ACKMODE lands upstream |

The script is idempotent — re-run it to update to a newer `main`. It
does **not** install pulseaudio / pipewire / jackd; samoyed initialises
PortAudio lazily so a daemon-less host works fine (see
`NOTES-audio-io.md`).

## Web UI

`sim-web` is a small integrated control surface. One page, one config
file, three buttons:

- **Start** — load the YAML and bring up the router with one samoyed
  child per port.
- **Apply & restart** — save the textarea contents to the YAML file
  (validated strictly) and recycle the router.
- **Stop** — tear it all down.

KISS TCP ports are listed live as the topology comes up so you know
where to point your AX.25 application.

`sim-web` embeds the router; it doesn't shell out to a separate
`sim-router` binary. Either one is a fine entrypoint:

- Engineer-loop / scripting: `sim-router -config configs/two-node.yaml`
- Day-to-day editing: the web UI.

## Manual install / build from source

If you'd rather not run an installer, the equivalent steps:

Prerequisites (Debian/Ubuntu):

- Go 1.22+ (`apt install golang`)
- `gcc`, `make`, `pkg-config`
- `libudev-dev libhamlib-dev portaudio19-dev libavahi-client-dev libbsd-dev libgps-dev libasound2-dev`
  (samoyed build-time deps — required even though we won't use any audio
  backend at runtime)
- samoyed checked out and built at `/opt/samoyed`:
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/doismellburning/samoyed /opt/samoyed
  make -C /opt/samoyed cmds
  ```
- Stock Dire Wolf (`apt install direwolf`) — reference only, not used at
  runtime.

Build:

```
make build       # builds sim-router and sim-web
```

Run the smallest demo:

```
make demo-two-node
```

Two AFSK1200 stations, fully linked, KISS exposed at `127.0.0.1:8001`
and `127.0.0.1:8002`. From another shell:

```
nc 127.0.0.1 8001 < some_kiss_frame.bin
nc 127.0.0.1 8002 | xxd                # see decoded frames
```

Or attach BPQ / kissutil / kissattach directly to those ports — the
router doesn't touch KISS frames, samoyed handles them natively.

## Demo topologies

| Target | What it shows |
|---|---|
| `make demo-two-node` | Single bidirectional AFSK1200 link. Sanity check. |
| `make demo-two-node-noisy` | Same plus deliberate path loss and noise — Phase 4: FER climbs visibly. |
| `make demo-hidden-node` | A↔B, B↔C, no A↔C; equal loss. Simultaneous TX from A and C produces collision at B. |
| `make demo-hidden-node-capture` | Same topology, A loud / C quiet. A captures the demodulator at B; C is suppressed. |
| `make demo-mesh-3` | Three-node fully connected mesh. |
| `make demo-linear-6` | A — B — C — D — E — F chain, each hears only immediate neighbours. |
| `make demo-star-6` | Hub + 5 spokes. |
| `make demo-multiport-3` | Three nodes; the middle one has two independent radio ports. |

Each demo prints its KISS port assignments at startup.

## YAML config

```yaml
mixer_mode: fm_capture        # fm_capture (default) | linear_sum (stub)
capture_db: 6.0               # FM capture ratio
collision_mode: silence       # silence (default) | noise (FM garble) | sum (stub)
time_scale: 1.0               # run N x faster than wall clock (>= 1.0; see below)

nodes:
  - id: a
    ports:
      - id: vhf               # unique within the node
        modem: { mode: afsk1200 }
        kiss_port: 8001       # the host-side TCP port for this port's KISS
      - id: uhf-link
        modem: { mode: gfsk9600 }
        kiss_port: 8002
  - id: b
    ports:
      - id: vhf
        modem: { mode: afsk1200 }
        kiss_port: 8003

links:
  # Directional. Both endpoints must use compatible modem configs.
  - { from: a.vhf, to: b.vhf, loss_db: 0 }
  - { from: b.vhf, to: a.vhf, loss_db: 0, squelch_open_ms: 50 }
```

Per-link `squelch_open_ms` (optional, `0..500`, default `0`) models the
receiving radio's squelch / carrier-detect opening delay: the first N ms
of every transmission heard via that link are delivered as silence (the
carrier is still on the air for capture/collision purposes — only the
audio is muted while the squelch opens). Real FM receivers take tens of
milliseconds to open squelch and settle the discriminator, which is
exactly why KISS TXDELAY exists; with the default `0` a tiny TXDELAY
looks fine in simulation when it wouldn't be on air.

Strict parsing: any unknown key inside a `modem:` block (e.g. `baud_rate`
when you meant `baud`) is an error at startup, not a silent default.

### time_scale — faster-than-real-time simulation

> **TNC pacing does not scale (measured):** samoyed paces its transmissions in
> wall-clock time (the real-airtime sleep before PTT release), so at
> `time_scale > 1` the TNC transmits in real time while the channel runs N×
> faster — TX throughput stays wall-clock-bound and ACKMODE echoes arrive N×
> "late" relative to a host whose protocol timers are scaled to match. In
> practice `time_scale` is currently only sound for receive-path/mixer
> experiments; ACKMODE pacing or throughput measurements need `time_scale: 1`
> until the TNC grows a matching speed factor (tracked upstream).

`time_scale: N` (or the `-time-scale N` flag on `sim-router`, which
overrides the config) runs the whole simulation N× faster than wall
clock: the router divides every pacing interval by N — the 10 ms
per-block RX ticker, the composite recorder's ticker, and the TX
watchdog's tick and silence window (silence detection has to scale with
the audio rate or `tx_end` events would fire mid-transmission). A 60 s
exchange completes in 60/N wall-clock seconds; recordings still come out
as normal 44.1 kHz files whose time axis is *sim* time.

**Fidelity caveat — read before trusting numbers from a scaled run.**
Only the router's clocks scale. The TNC child processes (samoyed /
direwolf) still run their own wall-clock behaviours — CSMA persist and
slottime waits, DCD hang times, any internal timeouts — which means at
`time_scale: 4` a TNC's 100 ms slottime is effectively 400 ms of sim
time. `time_scale > 1` is therefore an **accelerated-testing mode** (get
through a long soak/protocol exchange quickly), *not* a calibrated CSMA
/ channel-access simulation; for timing-sensitive contention studies run
at `1.0`. Hosts driving the KISS ports must also scale their own
protocol timers (T1/T2 etc.) by N, or their retries will fire N× too
early in sim time. Large factors are also bounded by CPU: every TNC
demodulator must keep up with N× real-time audio.

### TNC backend per port

Each port chooses which TNC implementation runs the modem:

```yaml
ports:
  - id: vhf
    tnc: samoyed        # default
    modem: { mode: afsk1200 }
    kiss_port: 8001
  - id: uhf
    tnc: direwolf       # stock direwolf 1.8 from apt
    modem: { mode: afsk1200 }
    kiss_port: 8002
```

| `tnc` | Audio TX path | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `samoyed` (default) | UDP datagrams | Clean and direct. |
| `direwolf` | ALSA `file` plugin → named pipe | Workaround until upstream Dire Wolf gains UDP audio out. The router writes a per-port `.asoundrc` and a FIFO into `WorkDir`. |

Both backends accept the same modem directives (`MODEM 9600`, `IL2PTX 1`,
etc.) in the per-port config file, so a mixed-TNC config works fine —
link compatibility is decided by modem alone, not by which TNC is on
either end.

### Modem catalogue

| `mode` | Required params | Status (current samoyed) |
|---|---|---|
| `afsk1200` | none | ✅ supported. Default workhorse. |
| `gfsk9600` | none | ✅ supported. Auto-selected for 9600 baud + G3RUH. |
| `bpsk` | `baud`, optional `carrier_hz` | ❌ not yet — refused at startup. |
| `il2p` | `inner` (afsk1200 / gfsk9600), `fec` (`strong`/`weak`) | ✅ supported (FEC strength only — see Known limitations). |

Modes the YAML accepts but samoyed can't actually run *fail at startup
with a clear error*. Adding a new mode is config plumbing — see the
translation table in `internal/samoyed/child.go` and the source-of-truth
table in `NOTES-audio-io.md`.

## Recording runs

Both `sim-router` and `sim-web` can write per-port WAV recordings of
every transmission and every receive-side mix. Files are mono 16-bit LE
PCM at 44.1 kHz — the simulator's native format, so recording is a
straight tee with no resampling.

**`sim-router`** — pass `-record DIR`. Recording starts as soon as the
router comes up. Each run gets its own timestamped subdirectory:

```
sim-router -config configs/hidden-node.yaml -record /tmp/sim-rec
# /tmp/sim-rec/20260506T120000Z/a.vhf.tx.wav
# /tmp/sim-rec/20260506T120000Z/a.vhf.rx.wav
# /tmp/sim-rec/20260506T120000Z/b.vhf.tx.wav   ...
```

For each port `<node>.<port>` you get two files:

- `*.tx.wav` — exactly what the TNC keyed onto the air.
- `*.rx.wav` — what the TNC's demodulator actually heard, post-mix:
  silence, captured signal, collision (silence in v1), and any per-link
  noise.

All `.rx.wav` files for a single run share a clock — they're sample-aligned,
so loading them into Audacity as separate tracks shows you exactly which
station a receiver was hearing at any moment.

**`sim-web`** — pass `-record DIR` to enable the feature; a Record
checkbox appears next to Start/Stop. Toggle it any time:

- **Off → on while running** — opens a fresh session immediately.
- **On → off while running** — closes the current session (WAV headers
  are patched on close so the files are valid).
- **Toggled while stopped** — recording is "armed"; it will start when
  the next Start/Apply &amp; restart brings the router up.

The toggle survives Apply &amp; restart, so you can edit the topology and
keep recording across the restart with one click.

**Disk usage**: ~88 KB/s per stream. A 6-node mesh with two streams per
port ≈ 1 MB/s, ≈ 3.5 GB/hour. WAV size is capped by a 32-bit chunk-size
field — at this rate a single file fills at ~13.5 hours. Long enough that
v1 doesn't rotate; short enough to mention.

**Crash safety**: WAV headers are patched on `Close`. If the process is
killed without a clean shutdown, the file is still readable as raw PCM
but its data-chunk size will say zero — most players will refuse to
play it. Stop the router cleanly (or click Record off) before pulling
the plug.

### Composite recording — true on-air timeline

The per-port `*.tx.wav` files above are written straight from each TNC
as it *bursts* its TX audio (samoyed can emit a 500 ms frame onto its
UDP socket in a few wall-clock ms), so they faithfully carry the
modulated waveform but are **not** a real-time timeline — you can't line
two of them up and trust the gaps.

A **composite recording** fixes that. It captures a chosen set of
transmitters into a *single*, sample-aligned, multi-channel WAV — one
transmitter per channel — and paces every channel through one real-time
clock (the same mechanism that feeds audio into the receivers). For the
canonical two-station setup that's a **stereo** file with one station's
transmitted audio in each ear. The result is an accurate timeline of
what was on the air: overlapping transmissions overlap in time,
inter-burst gaps are real silence, and both channels share one start
time. Drop it into Audacity and you can see at a glance who was keying
when — ideal for inspecting hidden-node collisions (put the two hidden
stations in left/right).

The audio is the clean transmitter output (full-scale, before any
per-link path loss, noise, or the capture-effect mixer) — it's what each
station actually put on the air, not what any particular receiver heard.

**`sim-router`** — pass `-composite a.vhf,b.vhf` together with `-record DIR`
(the base dir for the output). Recording starts as soon as the router
comes up and stops on a clean shutdown:

```
sim-router -config configs/hidden-node.yaml -record /tmp/sim-rec \
  -composite a.vhf,c.vhf
# /tmp/sim-rec/composite-20260604T120000.000Z.wav  (stereo: a.vhf left, c.vhf right)
```

List more than two ports for a multi-track WAV (one channel each, in the
order given).

**`sim-web`** — with `-record DIR` set, a **Composite recording** panel
appears on the control page: pick the Left-ear and Right-ear
transmitters, click **Start recording**, then **Stop recording** when
done, and **Download .wav**.

#### HTTP API (for external software)

Drive it from a test harness or any HTTP client. All endpoints live
under `/api/record/composite/` and need `sim-web` started with
`-record DIR` and the router running.

| Method & path | Body | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `POST /api/record/composite/start` | `{"ports":["a.vhf","c.vhf"]}` (optional) | Start a recording. Each port is one channel, in order (index 0 = left). Omit the body to default to the topology's first two ports. |
| `POST /api/record/composite/stop` | — | Finalise the file (patches the WAV header) and return its status. |
| `GET /api/record/composite/status` | — | Current state: `available`, `active`, `channels`, `path`, `duration_s`, and `download_url` once a file is complete. |
| `GET /api/record/composite/download` | — | Stream the most recently completed composite WAV as an attachment. |

A typical external run: `POST .../start` → exercise your stations over
KISS → `POST .../stop` → `GET .../download`. The `composite` block is
also included in `GET /api/status`.

## Why FM capture-effect mixing (and not linear sum)

A linear-sum mixer is simpler and is what most "audio bus" libraries
default to. It is also wrong for the dominant use case of this rig.

Real FM receivers exhibit the **capture effect**: when two FM signals
arrive simultaneously, the stronger one takes over the demodulator and
the weaker is suppressed, *provided* the level difference exceeds a
threshold (the "capture ratio", typically ~6 dB on narrow-band 2m FM).
This is why hidden-node collisions on 2 m packet are *intermittent*
rather than universal: a stronger station regularly punches through.

`sim-router` implements receiver-side capture-effect mixing per port:

```
for each rx block per receiving port:
  active := list of TX streams reaching this port right now
  if len(active) == 0: silence
  if len(active) == 1: that stream, attenuated per loss_db
  if len(active) >= 2:
    sort by RX level; margin = strongest − next
    if margin >= capture_db:  output strongest, attenuated  (capture)
    else:                     collision garbage              (per collision_mode)
```

This is what makes the `hidden-node` and `hidden-node-capture` demos do
qualitatively different things from the same code.

What "collision garbage" sounds like is selectable via `collision_mode`:

- `silence` (default) — clean digital silence. Simple and backwards
  compatible, but unrealistically *clean*: it hands receiving modems a
  perfectly quiet channel at exactly the moment a real one would be full
  of noise.
- `noise` — gaussian garble at an RMS matching the strongest colliding
  signal's post-loss level. A real FM discriminator outputs loud garble
  (the heterodyne beat between the carriers plus wideband noise) when
  two comparable carriers collide, at signal-comparable amplitude — so a
  hot collision is loud garble, a weak distant one quiet garble. Use
  this to exercise modem false-sync / DCD behaviour that the silence
  model can't.
- `sum` — accepted but still a stub (behaves as silence).

## Known limitations (samoyed-side, expected to be fixed upstream)

This is a gap in the current samoyed build that affects what you can
test against; it will likely land in samoyed soon and we'll bump the
pin then. Tracker issues:
[net-sim#1](https://github.com/packethacking/net-sim/issues/1) /
[net-sim#2](https://github.com/packethacking/net-sim/issues/2).

- **No IL2P+CRC (a.k.a. IL2Pc) support.** Samoyed implements the IL2P
  v0.6 base form — header + payload, Reed-Solomon FEC, no trailing 2-byte
  CRC. The `fec` field on `il2p` modems toggles RS strength (`strong` →
  `IL2PTX 1`, `weak` → `IL2PTX 0`); it does *not* enable the spec's
  optional trailing-CRC variant. If your application requires IL2Pc on
  the wire, this rig won't reproduce it yet. (The field used to be
  called `crc`, which was misleading — renamed to `fec` to match what
  it actually does.)
**KISS ACKMODE — now supported.** Previously samoyed's KISS layer refused
the XKISS ACKMODE opcode and dropped the frame; the pinned samoyed build now
implements G8BPQ extended-KISS ACKMODE (command nibble `0x0C`). Send a data
frame with two leading id bytes (`C0 xC aa bb <frame> C0`) and the TNC echoes
those two bytes back (`C0 xC aa bb C0`) once the frame has actually been
transmitted — so a host (some BPQ configurations, certain `ax25d` setups) can
start FRACK from the real on-air moment instead of from hand-off. The id bytes
are echoed verbatim. (The implementation currently lives on a samoyed fork,
[M0LTE/samoyed](https://github.com/M0LTE/samoyed/tree/feat/ackmode); net-sim
pins that build and will switch back to upstream samoyed once ACKMODE lands
there. XKISS poll mode and checksum mode remain unimplemented.) An end-to-end
round-trip test lives in `internal/tnc/ackmode_test.go`.

## What's not in v1

- BPQ / XRouter integration (works fine — point them at the KISS ports —
  but no demos shipped).
- Hot reload of topology (restart the router).
- Web UI / topology visualisation. Logs to stderr, that's the interface.
- Playback / injection of recorded WAVs back into the router (recording
  to WAV is supported — see "Recording runs" below).
- BER / FER reporting beyond the basic frame counters demonstrable from
  KISS sniffing.
- SSB modelling, AGC, pre/de-emphasis, multipath, Doppler, fading.
- `linear_sum` / `sum` mixer modes — accepted in the YAML, only
  `fm_capture` is functional (`collision_mode: silence` and `noise` both
  work; `sum` is a stub).
- Modem modes beyond what samoyed currently supports.

## Layout

```
cmd/sim-router/            - CLI entrypoint
