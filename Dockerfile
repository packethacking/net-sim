# Multi-stage build for the net-sim simulator (sim-router + sim-web).
#
# Builder stage: clones samoyed, compiles it; builds the Go binaries
# from this checkout.
#
# Runtime stage: a slim image carrying just the binaries, the
# samoyed-direwolf runtime libraries (libportaudio2 et al.), and the
# default two-node network at /etc/sim/network.yaml. Entrypoint is
# sim-web on :8080.
#
# Build:
#   docker build -t net-sim:dev .
#
# Run with the bundled two-node network:
#   docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 -p 8001:8001 -p 8002:8002 net-sim:dev
#
# Run with a custom network (any KISS port range):
#   docker run --rm --network=host \
#     -v ./my-network.yaml:/etc/sim/network.yaml \
#     net-sim:dev
#
# Published image: ghcr.io/packethacking/net-sim
# Tags: :main, :main-<sha>, :v<x.y.z>, :latest (on tagged release)

# ---- builder ------------------------------------------------------------
# samoyed's go.mod requires Go ≥ 1.25 (as of mid-2025). Bump in lockstep
# with samoyed's minimum.

# TEMPORARY PIN: KISS ACKMODE is not yet in doismellburning/samoyed; it lives
# as a single additive commit on the fork's main (M0LTE/samoyed @ 61bb965,
# upstream main + ACKMODE). When ACKMODE lands in doismellburning/samoyed,
# revert SAMOYED_REPO to https://github.com/doismellburning/samoyed.git and set
# SAMOYED_REF back to `main` (or that commit). Pinned to a fixed SHA so release
# images are reproducible rather than tracking a floating branch.

# container as root, or with that cap in the user-namespace) — NOT with file
# capabilities on the binaries. A `setcap cap_sys_nice+ep` here makes the
# binary REFUSE TO exec (EPERM "operation not permitted") on any host whose
# bounding set lacks the cap — e.g. an unprivileged LXC — breaking the image
# for everyone who isn't using -rt-priority. -rt-priority already degrades
# gracefully (logs a one-line warning and runs at normal priority) where the
# platform won't grant the cap, so the binary must stay capability-free.
